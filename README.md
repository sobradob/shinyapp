# ShinyGPS: An R Shiny App for Visualising Human Movements

## Overview

This repository hosts the R Shiny application I developed during my Master's in Methodology and Statistics. The app is designed to visualize human movements over time using sensor data from Android devices.

A live demo of the app is available [here](https://utrecht-university.shinyapps.io/shinygps/).

## Historical Context

I am updating this README six years post-thesis because I've noticed the app is still operational and continues to be cited and utilized. Currently, the app isn't reproducible as-is, due to its dependence on a local and sizable `RDS` file containing sensitive personal location data.

## Launching the App

The app can be launched in the same manner as any other Shiny App. For detailed instructions on launching Shiny Apps, please consult the official Shiny documentation [here](https://shiny.posit.co/r/getstarted/shiny-basics/lesson1/index.html).

Although the app references non-shareable personal data, test data is provided within this repository. Some adjustments might be necessary for the app to function with your data.

For a more comprehensive understanding and documentation, you can refer to the repository [here](https://github.com/sobradob/thesis). It includes my complete thesis, methodologies for extracting personal location data, data pre-processing techniques, and guidelines for visualizing the data using this Shiny app.
